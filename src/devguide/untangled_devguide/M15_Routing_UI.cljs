  "# Defining Routes

  Defining routes requires just a few steps:

  - Designate the idents of all screens that will be controlled by routers. The first element of the idents MUST be
  unique for a given router, and will identify which screen to render. The second element can be a literal value (keyword or number),
  or a keyword in the namespace `param`. In the latter case, `route-params` will be used during UI route updates
  to set that member to a value derived from the UI interactions.

  - Decide on a flat or tree structure. If you use only a single router, then all of your screens will be set up
  such that only one can be on the screen at a time. If you want to nest routers so that you can control subscreens
  within a given screen you'll need to define that.

  - Give each of the routers in your design an ID. For example :top-router and :report-router, along with an ident
  function that can extract the proper ident from the components it will route to.
  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source Main)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source TopRouter)
  "

  in the example above, the ident function of `TopRouter` will be used against the screens (e.g. `Main`) to produce idents
  like `[:main :top]`

  - Give each routable screen in your tree a handler name. For example, if screen A will show a subscreen B or C, then
  B and C will need app-wide unique names. If screen A were also (at times) a leaf (not showing B or C), it should also have
   a handler name.

```
                (top-router w/id :top-router)
                   ----------------------
                  /     /     |          \\
             :main  :login  :new-user    (report router w/id :report-router)
                                               |
                                (reports shared content screen)
                                               |
                                              / \\
                                        :status  :graph
```

  - Define your routing tree. This is a data structure that gives instructions to one-or-more routers that are necessary to
   place the screen from (4) front-and-center. For example, you need to tell the top router and report router in the above
   example to change what they are showing in order to get a `:status` or `:graph` on the screen.
  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source routing-tree)
  "

  - Compose your top-level router into your root, and place the routing tree into the top-level app state (e.g.
  using InitialAppState). The routing tree is considered singleton data and is not needed in the query.
  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source Root)
  "
  - You may place nested routers wherever you like, though they cannot be directly nested in other routers, since
  the parent router needs to use an ident function that is different from the ident of the routers. This should not
  be a problem since the only reason to nest routers is to show some portion of the parent screen while routing to
  a sub-screen. For example, a reports sub-screen can nest using something like this:
  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source ReportRouter)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source ReportsMain)
  "
  # Using the Routing Tree

  The routing library includes an Untangled mutation for placing a specific screen front-and-center. It is namespaced
  to the untangled.client.routing namespace, and takes and :handler and optional :route-params argument:

  ```
  ; assumes you've aliased untangled.client.routing to r
  (om/transact! `[(r/route-to {:handler :main})])
  ```

  ## Combining Routing with Data Management

  Of course you can compose this with other mutations into a single transaction. This is common when you're trying
  to switch to a screen whose data might not yet exist:

  ```
  (om/transact! `[(app/ensure-report-loaded {:report-id :a}) (r/route-to {:graph :a})])
  ```

  here we're assuming that `ensure-report-loaded` is a mutation that ensures that there is at least placeholder data in
  place (or the UI rendering might look a bit odd or otherwise fail from lack of data). It may also do things like trigger background
  loads that will fufill the graph's needs, something like this:

  ```
  (defmethod m/mutate 'app/ensure-report-loaded [{:keys [state] :as env} k {:keys [report-id]}]
    (let [when-loaded (get-in @state [:reports/by-id report-id :load-time-ms] 0)
          is-missing? (= 0 when-loaded)
          now-ms (.getTime (js/Date.))
          age-ms (- now-ms when-loaded)
          should-be-loaded? (or (too-old? age-ms) is-missing?)]
      ; if missing, put placeholder
      ; if too old, add remote load to Untangled queue (see data-fetch for remote-load and load-action)
      {:remote (when should-be-loaded? (df/remote-load env))
       :action (fn []
                 (when is-missing? (swap! state add-report-placeholder report-id))
                 (when should-be-loaded? (df/load-action state [:reports/by-id report-id] StatusReport)))}))
  ```

  Additional mutations might do things like garbage collect old data that is not in the view. You may also need to
  trigger renders of things like your main screen with follow-on reads (e.g. of a keyword on the root
  component of your UI). Of course, combining such things into functions adds a nice touch:

  ```
  (defn show-report!
    [component report-id]
    (om/transact! component `[(app/clear-old-reports)
                              (app/ensure-report-loaded {:report-id ~report-id})
                              (r/route-to {:graph ~report-id})
                              :top-level-key]))
  ```

  which can then be used more cleanly in the UI:

  ```
  (dom/a #js {:onClick #(show-report! this :a)} \"Report A\")
  ```

  # HTML5 Routing

  Hooking HTML5 or hash-based routing up to this is relatively simple using, for example, `pushy` and `bidi`.

  We do not provide direct support for this, since your application will need to make a number of decisions that
  really are local to the specific app:

  - How to map URIs to your leaf screens. If you use bidi then `bidi-match` will return exactly what you need from
  a URI route match (e.g. `{:handler :x :route-params {:p v}}`).

  - How to grab the URI bits you need. For example, `pushy` lets you hook up to HTML5 history events.

  - If a routing decision should be deferred/reversed? E.g. navigation should be denied until a form is saved.

  - How you want to update the URI on routing. You can define your own additional mutation to do this (e.g. via `pushy/set-token!`)
  and possibly compose it into a new mutations with `route-to`. The function `r/update-routing-links` can be used for
  such a composition:

  ```
  ; in some defmethod m/mutate
  (swap! state (fn [m]
                  (-> m
                      (r/update-routing-links { :handler :h :route-params p })
                      (app/your-state-updates)))
  (pushy/set-token! your-uri-interpretation-of-h)
  ```
  ")
